This project is ideally used bedside angled towards one's body. In my GitHub, the web server intervals for the ultrasonic sensor are too small, and result in outliers (1200cm+), so you should increase them to 3-5 seconds. To use this code, you'll need to initialize the ESP32 as a board so it is recognized by Arduino IDE. Then you'll need to install the ESP32 Filesystem Uploader and place the HTML file in a folder with the Arduino IDE sketch.
